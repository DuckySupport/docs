The base ratelimit is 20 requests per 10 seconds. Do not hardcode any values— instead, use the following headers which are found in every response:

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Limit" type="number">
  The amount of requests allowed before hitting the ratelimit.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Remaining" type="number">
  The number of remaining requests that can be made before hitting the ratelimit.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-RateLimit-Reset" type="number">
  The epoch timestamp (in seconds) of when the ratelimit will reset.
</ResponseField>

The following body is also provided when the ratelimit is hit:
```json 429 Response
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "Too many requests, please try again later."
}
