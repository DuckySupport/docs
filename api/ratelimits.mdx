The base ratelimit is 20 requests per 10 seconds. Do not hardcode any values. Use the following headers found in every response:

<ResponseField name="header" type="x-ratelimit-limit">
  The amount of requests that can be made before receiving a 429.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="header" type="x-ratelimit-remaining">
  The number of remaining requests that can be made.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="header" type="x-ratelimit-reset">
  Epoch timestamp when the rate limit resets.
</ResponseField>

#### 429 response:
```json
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "Too many requests, please try again later."
}
