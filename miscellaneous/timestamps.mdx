The **`{timestamp}`** variable is one of the most confusing variables in Ducky for those who aren't familiar with Discord's formatting style.

When using the variable without formatting, you'll receive a number such as **1755465534**. This isn't very useful, nor readable. To make it readable, you must add formatting as shown below.

- **Thursday, December 19, 2024, at 6:49 AM:** `<t:1734608947:F>`
- **December 19, 2024 at 6:49 AM:** `<t:1734608947:f>`
- **December 19, 2024:** `<t:1734608947:D>`
- **12/19/2024:** `<t:1734608947:d>`
- **6:49 AM:** `<t:1734608947:t>`
- **6:49:07 AM:** `<t:1734608947:T>`
- **5 seconds ago:** `<t:1734608947:R>`

<Warning>
    Be sure to replace the numbers with the **`{timestamp}`** variable. Example: **`<t:{timestamp}:R>`**.
