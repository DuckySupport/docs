This page provides the essential configuration options to help you get started quickly, including setting your command prefix, managing disabled commands, changing permission roles (see [Permissions](https://docs.duckybot.xyz/configuration/permissions)), configuring a configuration log channel, and resetting your configuration. Once you have invited Ducky to your server, use the **`/setup`** command to get started.

<Warning>
  All members with the **Manage Server** permission are authorized to access the **`/setup`** command.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prefix" titleSize="h2">
    The **Prefix** determines how prefix-based commands are triggered in your server. You can change it on this page to fit your server's style, or to prevent conflicts with other bot prefixes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disabled Commands" titleSize="h2">
    This option allows you to disable specific Ducky commands you do not want to be available in your server. Disabled commands will have a response of "This command has been disabled by server management." when triggered/used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Command Blacklists" titleSize="h2">
    This option allows you to blacklist specific channels or roles from interacting with Ducky.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Permissions" titleSize="h2">
    Configure permission roles to manage what each member can access.
    <Note>
      For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions](https://docs.duckybot.xyz/configuration/permissions).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration Log Channel" titleSize="h2">
    This is where all changes to Ducky's configuration within your server will be logged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wipe Configuration" titleSize="h2">
    This option allows you to completely **wipe your server's configuration**. You will need to reconfigure everything from scratch.
    <Danger>
      Wiping your server's configuration is **permanent** and cannot be revertedâ€” therefore only the **server owner** can use this option.
    </Danger>
