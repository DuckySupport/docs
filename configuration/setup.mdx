This page provides the essential configuration options to help you get started quickly, including setting your command prefix, managing disabled commands, changing permission roles (see [Permissions](/configuration/permissions)), configuring a configuration log channel, and resetting your configuration. Once you have invited Ducky to your server, use the **`/setup`** command to get started.

<Warning>
  All members with the **Manage Server** permission are authorized to use the **`/setup`** command.
</Warning>

## Prefix

The **Prefix** determines how prefix-based commands are triggered in your server. You can change it on this page to fit your server's style, or to prevent conflicts with other bot prefixes.

## Disabled Commands

This option allows you to disable specific Ducky commands you do not want to be available in your server.

To input commands, use the command names without any prefix or slash. For example, to disable the **`/ping`** command, simply input **`ping`**. To disable both the **`/ping`** and **`/say`** commands, input **`ping, say`**.

## Command Blacklists

This option allows you to blacklist specific channels or roles from interacting with Ducky.

## Permissions

Configure permission roles to manage what each member can access.

<Note>
  For more detailed information on permissions, see [Permissions](/configuration/permissions).
</Note>

## Configuration Log Channel

The **Configuration Log Channel** is the channel where Ducky will send a message to when any changes are made to the server's configuration using the **`/setup`** command.

## Wipe Configuration

This option allows you to completely **wipe your server's configuration**. This includes all data stored within your server such as punishments, shifts, etc.

<Danger>
  Wiping your server's configuration is **permanent** and cannot be reverted— therefore, only the **server owner** can use this option.
