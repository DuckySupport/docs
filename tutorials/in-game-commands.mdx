<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your ER:LC Server">
    <Tip>
      Only the owner of the ER:LC server can do this.
    </Tip>
    Join your ER:LC server and click the server icon (top-right). Select **Edit Server Settings**, find **API Key**, click **Edit**, and copy it. In `/setup`, go to the **ERLC Integration** page, select **Edit ERLC API Key**, paste the copied key, and submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="ER:LC Command Logs">
    Create a channel where all commands used in-game will be logged. In the edit menu of the channel, click **Integrations**. Here, create a webhook, and copy the URL. In your ER:LC server settings (the same place where you got your API Key), search **Commands Log Webhook**. Edit it to the webhook you copied.

    <Tip>
      Try it out by using a command.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring with Ducky">
    On the **ERLC Integration** page in `/setup`, change the **Command Logs Channel** to the channel you created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    You can now use Ducky In-game commands. To view a list of all commands, use `/help` → Commands → In-Game Commands.
