<Warning>
  You must be the owner of the ERLC private server in order to access the private server settings necessary for this configuration.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your ERLC Server">
    1. Join your ERLC server.
    2. Press the server stack icon on the top right corner of the screen.
    3. Select **Edit Server Settings**.
    4. Search for **API Key**.
    5. Press **Edit**, and copy the API key.
    6. Run the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **ERLC Integration** page.
    7. Select **Edit API Key**, and paste the key you copied.
    8. Press **Submit**, and your server should be linked.

    <Note>
      This is so Ducky can reply in-game via PM, but it's not required. If you do not configure this, Ducky will reply via DMs.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="ERLC Command Logs">
    1. Create a channel where all commands used in-game will be logged.
    2. Edit the channel, and select the **Integrations** tab.
    3. Create a new webhook, and copy the URL. You do not have to change the webhook's name or avatar.
    4. Head back to your ERLC private server's settings.
    5. Search for **Command Logs Webhook**.
    6. Press **Edit**, and paste the webhook URL you copied.

    <Tip>
      Confirm that you pasted the webhook URL correctly by running any private server command. It should appear in the channel you created.
    </Tip>
    <Note>
      Command logs are managed by ERLC, not Ducky. If they randomly stop working, it's likely due to one of the following:

      - A security bot, such as Wick, has deleted the webhook due to embed spam. Be sure to whitelist the channel or webhook you created using the appropriate command for the security service you use.
      - The PRC API is experiencing issues. Nobody but the PRC development team can resolve the issue, so simply be patient and wait for the issue to be resolved.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring with Ducky">
    1. Run the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **ERLC Integration** page.
    2. Select **Edit Command Logs Channel**, and select the channel you created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link your Roblox Account">
    1. Run the **`/link`** command, and press **Link**.
    2. As shown on the page you are redirected to, authorize Ducky to access your Roblox and Discord usernames and IDs in order to link your accounts together.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed">
    You are now able to use Ducky's in-game commands. To view a full list of all available in-game commands, run the **`/help`** command and navigate to **Commands** -\> **In-Game Commands**.

    <Tip>
      You can run a quick test to ensure everything is working correctly by running the **`:log ping`** command in-game.
