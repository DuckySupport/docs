## About

**Ducky **is a flexible bot that connects Discord with ER:LC server automation. It helps server owners and community managers manage their servers easily. Developed by [**Troptop**](https://discord.com/users/598958193032560642)** **and [**bobbibones**](https://discord.com/users/782235114858872854), Ducky operates on [**Quackscordia**](https://github.com/DuckySupport/Quackscordia), which is a modified version of [**Discordia**](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia), the Discord API wrapper for **Lua**. This strong base ensures smooth communication between Discord and your ER:LC server. It allows for automated moderation, role synchronization, live server tracking, and customizable features that improve both performance and user experience. 

Whether you run a small community or a large server network, Ducky provides tools to make managing it efficient and enjoyable. It simplifies complex tasks into straightforward commands. If you find a bug, need help, want to propose a new feature, or simply wish to stay updated, [**Ducky's Pond**](https://discord.gg/w2dNr7vuKP) is the right place for you. There, you can talk to the developers, preview upcoming features, check the bot’s live status, read update logs, and join a growing community of users focused on enhancing Ducky’s capabilities.
