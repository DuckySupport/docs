As of v1.6.0 Stable, we're moving our detailed changelogs from Discord to our documentation for better formatting and a much larger character limit.

<Update label="v1.6.0 Stable" description="January 31, 2026">
    **The first update of 2026 is here!** We've been working on v1.6.0 Stable for a while now, and after weeks of testing, development, and even more testing, it's finally ready.

    Here's what's new in **v1.6.0 Stable**:
    ### Automations
    - We've added **3 new actions** to **Automations**:
        - **Lock Channel:** Lock a specified channel.
        - **Unlock Channel:** Unlock a specified channel.
        - **Re-check Conditions:** Re-check the automation's conditions, and do not continue executing the automation if they are no longer met.
        <Warning>
            The **Re-check Conditions** action requires a **Delay** action prior to it.
        </Warning>

    ### ERLC Playtime Rewards
    - Our new **ERLC Playtime** bridge between **Usersettings** and the **ERLC Integration** module is here, bringing you the ability to reward and track your most active players.
    - You can now configure playtime rewards via the **ERLC Integration** page. For more information, check out the [documentation](/modules/erlcintegration.mdx).
    - Members are able to opt-out of playtime tracking via **`/usersettings`** -> **Edit settings...** -> **Toggle Track Playtime**.
    <Warning>
        The member must also have their Roblox account linked to Ducky in order to track playtime.
    </Warning>

    ### Components Editor
    - Our new **Components Editor** is now available via the **`/message`** command.
    - The **Components Editor** allows you to add buttons, dropdowns, and more with message responses determined by exportables.
    - This was a very highly-requested feature by the community, and we're excited to finally bring it to you.
    - You'll soon be able to use this in other places such as welcome messages in a future update.

    ### Improved Builders
    - We've started using **Modals v2** for our builders. This update marks the start of this transition, so keep in mind that not all builders are completely transferred to Modals v2.
    - Modals v2 offers many clean and useful components such as option, role, and channel dropdowns, text inputs, checkboxes (soon...), and more.
    - We're also using better labels for the different options. For example, instead of asking the user for **Required Role**, it asks, **What role should be required to use this shift type?**
    - The transition can already be found in places such as the **Economy**, **Shift Management**, and **ERLC Integration** pages of **`/setup`**.

    ### On-Shift Nickname Prefix
    - You can now add an on-shift nickname prefix that will automatically be appended to member's nicknames when they go on-shift.
    - This can be edited via the **Shift Type Builder** on the **`/setup`** -> **Shift Management** page.

    ### Coinflip and Reminders
    - The new **`/coinflip`** command lets you flip a coin and determine heads or tails.
    - The new **`/reminders list|set|cancel`** command lets you manage your own reminders. You'll automatically be reminded via DMs when it's time to be reminded.

    ### Ticket Close Reason & Transcript Fixes
    - We've resolved issues regarding 0-byte or empty transcripts. This issue was caused by deleting the ticket too fast, which meant that it was being deleted while the transcript was being generated.
    - You can now include a **close reason** which will be sent along with the transcript to the opener.
    - Additionally, the category name limit has been bumped from 25 -> 50.

    ### Discord Staff Immunity
    - You can now toggle **Staff Immunity** on the **Discord Moderation** page of **`/setup`**.
    - When enabled, this prevents your staff members from moderating eachother. This is disabled by default.

    ### Joingate & Direct Welcome Message
    - Welcome/AutoRoles is now Welcome/Autoroles. Huge change, we know.
    - You can now configure a **Direct Welcome Message**, which is automatically sent via the member's DMs when they join.
    - You can also configure a **Joingate** for your server, which automatically kicks users who have an account younger than the **Joingate Threshold**.

    ### Exportable Cross-Type Support
    - You can now import exportables of different types than what you need.
    - For example, if you have an **Embed** exportable but you want to import it into the **Message Editor**, you can do just that, and it will automatically transform the data structure appropriately.

    <Warning>
        Exportables of the **Panel** type can still only be imported into the **Ticket Panel Builder**.
    </Warning>

    ### Role Command Toggles
    - The **`d!role`** command no longer needs you to specify a subcommand such as `add` or `remove`.
    - If no subcommand is provided, it will now **toggle** the role on the member.
    - For example, if the **@troptopreal** already has the **Quacker** role and **`d!role troptopreal Quacker`** is used, the **Quacker** role will be **removed** from **@troptopreal**.

    ### Membercount Goal Projection
    - The **`/membercount`** command now has an optional **`goal`** argument.
    - This will show an approximation of how long/when the server will hit that amount of members.
    <Warning>
        This is **not** guaranteed to be 100% accurate, but is rather a rough estimate.
    </Warning>

    ### Whitelisted Antiping Channels
    - You can now configure specific channels where antiping will not be triggered.

    ### Editable Verification Panels
    - You can now edit your **Roblox Verification Panel** instead of having to recreate a new one every time.

    ### Careers Page
    - We've added a [**Careers**](https://duckybot.xyz/careers) page to our website, which displays requirements and the application for the position.

    ### Documentation Progress
    - We're making progress on writing our [**Documentation**](/overview/welcome.mdx) as our team of **Docwriters** continues to grow.
    - All existing pages will be kept up-to-date, and are up-to-date right now.

    ### Quality of Life Changes
    - Renamed **Welcome/AutoRoles** -> **Welcome/Autoroles**
    - Renamed **Discord Server Status** -> **Discord Server Statistics**
    - Added markdown string to **`/emoji view`**
    - Added username instead of nickname to lock/unlock channel logs
    - Added unmute reason to the DM notification sent to the member
    - Added proper sorting to the **`/feedback view`** command
    - Added bypass for sanitization of **`/say`** for members with the **Manage Server** permission
    - Rewrote our variable replacing utility to use better pattern matching and prevent unwanted replacement
    - Deprecated skull (custom "💀") emoji and use the swords (custom "⚔️") instead
    - Deprecated usage of `sub` and replaced it with `usub` to chop strings by characters instead of bytes (prevents "Invalid JSON" errors)
    - Autoresponders now mention on reply
    - Automations are now executed asynchronously to prevent the **Delay** action from affecting the server's ERLC server status messages, channels, logs, etc.
