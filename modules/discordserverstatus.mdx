Here you you can learn how to create theses stats and how to use the Varibles.

**Creating a Status Channel**

In order to create a status channel, you must use the **varibles given to you** in the  **Varbles**  section in the dropdown menu when attempting to create a discord server stats channel. Once you have selected the varible you wish to use for the stats channel, click **\+ Status Channel** and name it what you want and then put the varible in. For example: Guild Name: `{guild.name}`.
