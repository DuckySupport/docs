**Autoresponders** are a powerful way to improve your Discord server. With custom triggers and responses, you can have Ducky automatically give useful information to users.

### Create New Autoresponder

To create a new autoresponder, run the `/setup` command and navigate to the **Autoresponders** page. Select **Create New Autoresponder** from the dropdown and fill out all required fields.

#### Name

Create an easily identifiable **name** for your autoresponder. This name will be shown in your list of autoresponders.

#### Trigger

The word or phrase a user says to make Ducky respond is called the **trigger**. Your trigger should be short enough so users can easily trigger it, but it should not be so short that it is triggered because the phrase is so common.

#### Response

The **response** is what Ducky says when responding to the trigger. You can use text, text and an embed. See the [embed editor guide](/misc/embededitor) for more information on how to customize embeds.

#### Required Role

When enabled, only users with the **required role** will be responded to. This will make Ducky only respond to the trigger when the message is sent by a user with the required role.

#### Case Sensitive

**Case-sensitivity** will only respond to a user's message if it has the same capitalization as the trigger. For instance, if your trigger is `Ducky is the best!` and case-sensitivity is **off**, a user sending the message `ducky is the best!` _will_ be responded to. If case-sensitivity is **on**, a user sending that message will _not_ be responded to.

#### Check Exact Match

When enabled, a user's message much exacly to the trigger. For instance, if the trigger is`Ducky is the best!` and a user sends the message `I love ducky so much, Ducky is the best!` with **Check Exact Match** enabled, then Ducky will not respond. If diabled, Ducky will respond to the message because it contains the trigger.

#### Delete Trigger

When enabled, the user's message which contains the trigger will be deleted by Ducky when it responds.

#### Cooldown

When enabled, a **cooldown** will be placed on how quickly Ducky responds to that trigger. For insance, if someone is spamming the same phrase, Ducky will only respond once in the specificed amount of time.

<Warning>
  To prevent ratelimits and clutter, you are heavily reccomended to enable a cooldown of at least 1 minute. Not doing so enables spammers to send the same phrase over and over, clogging chat and limiting Ducky's responses.
