## Reaction Type

This is the reaction which users can react to a message with to send it to the board channel. You must set this by reacting to the message Ducky sends when you select this setting.

<Warning>
  You must **react** to the message, you cannot reply to it with your emoji of choice.
</Warning>

## Reaction Board Channel

This is the channel where all messages are sent once they reach the set reaction target. This can be configured to any **text channel**.

## Amount of Reactions Needed

To prevent every message with the configured reaction from going to the reaction board, you must configure how many reactions a message must get to get sent to the reaction board. The number of reactions to be sent can only go from 1 to 100. Once a message reaches the configured number of reactions, it will be automaticaly sent to the reaction board channel.

## Whitelisted Channels

A whitelisted channel is a channel where this reaction board applies. If a message reaches the reaction threshold and it isn't a whitelisted channel, the message will not be sent to your board channel.

<Note>
  By default, all channels are whitelisted.
