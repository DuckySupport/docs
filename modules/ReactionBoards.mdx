This page provides the essential configuration options for Duckyâ€™s **Reaction Boards** module, which allows you to let members pin messages to a board channel using a set amount of reactions. Use the `/setup` command and navigate to the **Reaction Boards** page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reaction Type" titleSize="h2">
    This is the reaction which users can react to a message with to send it to the board channel. You must set this by reacting to the message Ducky sends when you select this setting.

    <Warning>
      You must **react** to the message, you cannot reply to it with your emoji of choice.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reaction Board Channel" titleSize="h2">
    This is the channel where all messages are sent once they reach the set reaction target. This can be configured to any **text channel**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Amount of Reactions Needed" titleSize="h2">
    To prevent every message with the configured reaction from going to the reaction board, you must configure how many reactions a message must get to get sent to the reaction board. The number of reactions to be sent can only go from 1 to 100. Once a message reaches the configured number of reactions, it will be automaticaly sent to the reaction board channel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Whitelisted Channels" titleSize="h2">
    A whitelisted channel is a channel where this reaction board applies. If a message reaches the reaction threshold and it isn't a whitelisted channel, the message will not be sent to your board channel.

    <Note>
      By default, all channels are whitelisted.
