This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky’s **Message Management** module, which allows you to sticky messages, auto-delete channels and create valuable messages. Use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Message Management** page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sticky Messages" titleSize="h2">
    A sticky message is a message that Ducky will send to a set channel. Every time a message in that channel is sent.

    Ducky will send your sticky message, and it automatically deletes the last sticky message to keep your channel nice and clear, whilst keeping the stickied message as the first in the channel.

    <Info>
      You can customise sticky messages to better suit your needs

  <Step title="Auto Delete Channels" titleSize="h2">
    Auto-delete channels are also referred to as Auto-Purging. Ducky will automatically delete all messages in a channel after a set amount of time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Valuable Messages" titleSize="h2">
    A valuable message is a message Ducky will preserve if they are included in a message purge, and it will give you a prompt asking if you want to purge the message.
