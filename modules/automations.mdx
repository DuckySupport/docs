**Automations** are a powerful way to automate your ERLC private server. With over 30+ triggers, conditions, and actions, you can create custom events and commands such as staff requests, automatic session management, mass RDM detection, welcome messages, Discord checks, raid rollbacks, and _so much more_.

## Creating an Automation

### Getting Started

To create an automation, run the **`/automations create`** command. This will open up the **Automations Builder**, allowing you to customize your new automation.

### Adding a Name

To add an identifiable name to your automation, select the **Edit Name** option within the **Edit this Automation** dropdown menu.

### Disabling Automations

In the event that you would like to disable this automation without deleting it, select **Disable** within the **Edit this Automation** dropdown menu.

### Results Channel

Adding a **Results Channel** allows Ducky to send a message to that channel whenever an automation is sent, detailing whether an automation ran successfully or not, and which actions were run successfully or not.i

### Customize

The **Customize** menu allows futher customization of an automation, including required roles, custom arguments, and custom slash commands.

**Required Role**\
When enabled, all users using the automation must have the specified role. Users who attempt this command without the required role will not be able to run the automation.

**Custom Arguments**\
Custom Arguments allow you to ask for up to 5 arguments. Arguments are additional pieces of information that a user provides when executing a command. Making an argument required means that users using the automation must fill it out; making an argument not required means that users using the automation no not need fill it out.

**Custom Slash Commands**\
Custom Slash Commands allow you to create a designated slash command that users can run (instead of `/automations run`). The slash command cannot contain spaces, consider opting for underscores.

<Note>
  The customize menu is only available when your automation trigger is set to **Manual**.
</Note>

## Logic

The logic is what happens within your automation. This includes the trigger, conditions, and actions. We'll break down what each of them does and how to fully use it properly.

**Triggers**\
Triggers are what activate your automation. Once the trigger is met, it'll run your actions, or check for conditions if that's what you have setup.

<Warning>
  Some triggers, including ones that use your configured ERLC server, require linking your ERLC API to Ducky, or using Ducky's [Roblox Verification Module](/modules/RobloxVerification) to verify your member's Roblox accounts.
</Warning>

**Conditions**\
Conditions tell your automations when and when not to trigger. These conditions include: Role Conditions, Playercount, Team, Session Status, and when the automation was last triggered

**Actions**\
Actions are steps that happen after your trigger and conditions are met. These include Sending Commands to ERLC, Session Management, and More.

<Warning>
  Sending ERLC Commands requires linking your ERLC API to Ducky.
