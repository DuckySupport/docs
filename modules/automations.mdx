Ducky's **Automations** are a powerful way to automate your ERLC private server. With over 30+ triggers, conditions, and actions, you can create custom events and commands such as staff requests, automatic session management, mass RDM detection, welcome messages, Discord checks, raid rollbacks, and *so much more*.

## Creating an Automation
<Steps>
  <Step title="Getting Started" titleSize="h2">
    To create an automation, run the **`/automations create`** command. This will open up the **Automations Builder**, allowing you to customize your new automation using the **Edit this automation...** dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding a Name" titleSize="h2">
    To add an identifiable name to your automation, select the **Edit Name** option within the **Edit this automation...** dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disabling Automations" titleSize="h2">
    In the event that you would like to disable this automation without deleting it, you can do so by selecting the **Disable** option within the **Edit this automation...** dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Logic" titleSize="h2">
    The logic is what happens within your automation. This includes the trigger, conditions, and actions. We'll break down what each of them does and how to fully use it properly.

    <Steps>
      <Step title=" Triggers" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h3">
        Triggers are what activate your automation. Once the trigger is met, it'll run your actions, or check for conditions if that's what you have setup.

        <Warning>
          Some triggers, including ones that use your configured ER:LC server, require Linked API, and the player to be Linked with Ducky.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Conditions" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h3">
        Conditions tell your automations when and when not to trigger. These conditions include: Role Conditions, Playercount, Team, Session Status, and when the automation was last triggered
      </Step>
      <Step title="Actions" stepNumber={5} titleSize="h3">
        Actions are steps that happen after your trigger and conditions are met. These include Sending Commands to ER:LC, Session Management, and More.

        <Warning>
          Sending ER:LC Commands Requires Linked API.
