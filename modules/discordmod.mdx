This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky's **Discord Moderation** module, which provides a centralized system to monitor, record, and manage all Discord-related punishments issued via Ducky. To enable and configure this module, use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Discord Moderation** page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Modlogs Channel" titleSize="h2">
    The **Modlogs Channel** is where all moderation actions and log messages will be sent.

    Logged moderation actions include warning a member, muting a member, unmuting a member, kicking a member, banning a member, unbanning a member, purging messages, locking a channel, unlocking a channel, editing a case, and voiding a case via Ducky.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Appeal Links" titleSize="h2">
    The **Appeal Link** is an optional URL included in the DM sent to a user when they are moderated.

    This should direct the user to your **appeal system**, such as an [**appeal.gg**](https://appeal.gg/) link, a [**Google Form**](https://forms.google.com/), or a [**Discord Server**](https://discord.com).
