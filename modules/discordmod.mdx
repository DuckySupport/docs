This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky's **Discord Moderation** module, which provides a centralized system to monitor, record, and manage all Discord-related punishments issued via Ducky. To enable and configure this module, use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Discord Moderation** page.

### Modlogs Channel

The **Modlogs Channel** is where all moderation actions and log messages will be sent. This includes warning, muting, unmuting, kicking, banning, or unbanning a member, along with purging, locking, and unlocking a channel. This also includes logs for editing or voiding a case.

### Appeal Links

The **Appeal Link** is an optional URL included in the DM sent to a user when they are moderated. This should direct the user to your **appeal system**, such as an [**appeal.gg**](https://appeal.gg/) link, a **Google Form**, or a **Discord Server**.
