This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky's **ER:LC Integration** module, which enables seamless remote management and monitoring of your ER:LC private server. To enable and configure this module, use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **ER:LC Integration** page.

## In-Game Role
    The **In-Game Role** is a role that players within the linked ER:LC private server will be granted. This role is added from the member when they join the in-game server, and removed when they leave the in-game server.
    <Warning>
      The member must have their **Roblox** account linked with Ducky in order for this role to be added/removed from them.
    </Warning>
  
## ER:LC Server
    The **ER:LC Server** is the linked ER:LC private server. Learn how to Link your ER:LC Private Server [here](/tutorials/linkER:LC).
  
## Advanced ER:LC Command Permissions
    The **Advanced ER:LC Command Permissions** toggle determines whether or not your staff team have access to **`/ER:LC command`**. 
    
    When **enabled**, members of the configured **ER:LC Staff** roles have access to **`/ER:LC command`** but can only execute commands they would be able to execute in-game (i.e. an in-game moderator cannot use **`/ER:LC command`** to ban/unban).
    
    When **disabled**, only members of the configured **ER:LC Manager** roles can access **`/ER:LC command`** with the Co-Owner permission level.
  
## ER:LC Command Logs Channel
    The **ER:LC Command Logs Channel** is the channel that contains the ER:LC Command Logs webhook. For more information, click [here](/tutorials/ingamecmds).
  
## ER:LC Kick/Ban Logs Channel
    The **ER:LC Kick/Ban Logs Channel** is the channel that contains the ER:LC Kick/Ban Logs webhook. For more information, click [here](/tutorials/ingamecmds).
  
## Auto Log Kicks/BOLOs
    The **Auto Log Kicks/BOLOs** toggle determines whether or not Ducky automatically reads logs from the configured **ER:LC Kick/Ban Logs Channel** in order to automatically log punishments and/or complete active BOLOs.
  
## Ban Syncing Mode
    The **Ban Syncing Mode** is the mode that Ducky uses to synchronize bans between the ER:LC private server and the Discord server. The available options can be found below:
    - **Discord to ER:LC:** Members banned within the Discord server will automatically be banned from the ER:LC private server.
    - **ER:LC to Discord:** Players banned within the ER:LC private server will automatically be banned from the Discord server.
    - **Both:** Members banned within the Discord server will automatically be banned from the ER:LC private server, and players banned within the ER:LC private server will automatically be banned from the Discord server.
    - **None:** Ban synchronization will not occur.
