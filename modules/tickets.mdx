## Ticket Subjects

The ticket subjects are what the members interact with. These can be fully customized with different Support Roles, Mentionables, Categories, and more.

### Ticket Subject Builder

**Name**\
The name is the name that the ticket subject will be called. This is seen publicly on the ticket embed.

**Description**\
The description is a short description about your ticket subject. This can be used for what the category is meant for, or reasons to open it, etc.

**Emoji**\
The emoji is a chosen emoji that is shown on the dropdown menu of your ticket panel. This emoji can be either a Discord Emoji or a Custom Server Emoji.

<Note>
  The emoji's ID can be found by right-clicking the emoji and selecting "Copy ID". This requires Discord Developer Mode.
</Note>

**Category**\
The category is the channel that the created ticket channel is placed in. You can input a Category Name or a Category ID. This may require Discord Developer Mode.

**Transcripts Channel**\
The transcripts channel is where closed tickets are logged, and transcripts are kept. A transcript contains all messages exchanged within the ticket. The transcript is accessible using the .txt file provided, or by clicking "Web Transcript."

**Unclaimed/Claimed Ticket Names**\
The unclaimed ticket name is the name of the created ticket channel while the ticket is **unclaimed**. The claimed ticket name is a separate name for the ticket channel when the ticket is **claimed**.

<Tip>
  Use the **Variables** selection to view variables that you can place in your ticket name.
</Tip>

**Form**\
The form is a set of questions that are asked to the member when they open a ticket of that subject. The creator will be prompted to complete the form and submit it. Once submitted, the ticket is created normally, and another embed is attached, providing the answers of the form, and the question that was asked.

<Warning>
  Without **Ducky Plus+**, only two form questions can be made by default; upgrade to **Ducky Plus+** to create additional form questions.
</Warning>

**Support Roles**\
Support roles are roles that can **view, send messages, and interact** with the created ticket channel. When a ticket is claimed, the Support Roles loose access to view the channel, and the claimer keeps them.

**Mentionables**\
Mentionables are roles and members that receive a mention within the channel when a ticket is created.

<Note>
  We recommend adding your Support Roles as Mentionables.
</Note>

**Blacklisted Roles**\
Blacklisted roles are roles that are prohibited from interacting with your ticket subject and cannot open new tickets.

**Embed Editor**\
You can fully customize each embed that is seen within a ticket channel to your liking.
