This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky's **Server Economy** module, which allows your members to participate in a fun, engaging in-server economy. The module creates a centralized system for collecting and managing **:quack: Quacks**, ensuring all transactions and balances are properly tracked. To enable and configure this module, use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Server Economy** page.

### ER:LC-Integrated Bounties

**ER:LC-Integrated bounties** allows your server members to set bounties on in-game players, and rewarding the player who kills them with Economy currency. Multiple players can add a bounty on a player via the `/bounty add` command. Active bounties can be viewed via the **`/bounty list <player>`**. Server managers can remove + refund a bounty placed on a player.

<Note>
  The bounty claimer must be linked via Ducky to receive the reward. Your server must have the Economy module enabled, and your [ER:LC private server API Key](/tutorials/linkerlc) must be linked.
