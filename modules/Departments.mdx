This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky’s **Departments** module, which allows you to cross-ban members in your departments, sync Discord display names and utilise linked roles. Use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Departments** page.

## Linking Departments

1. In your main server (the **host server**), run the command  `/setup`, then navigate to the departments module.
1. Once on the department panel, navigate to the drop-down menu and select **Link Department.**
1. Obtain the server/guild ID of the department you want to link and paste it into the popup.
1. A message will be sent to the server owner of the department server. They must accept it within 10 minutes.

<Note>
  To link department servers, you will need the guild (server) ID. It will greatly help you to first enable [developer mode](https://docs.duckybot.xyz/misc/devmode) on Discord.

## Features of The Departments Module

  ### Username Syncing
    To enable username syncing, you need to navigate to the same drop-down where you linked your department and select **Toggle Sync Names**. Then, choose the department you want to sync usernames with. 
  
  ### Cross-Banning
    When cross-ban is enabled, running the `/ban` command will automatically ban the user from the server they are in and all departments. 

    The **Departmental** field is required to be set to **True** in order for this command to work. If it is set to off, it will not work.

    <Warning>
      You cannot cross-unban somebody from all linked servers using Ducky; you must unban them from each server they were banned in manually.
    </Warning>
  
  ### Linked Roles
    In essence, if a member has a role in the Host server, Ducky will give the linked role in the Department Server and vice versa

    1. Navigate to the drop-down menu and select "**Create Linked Role**".
    2. Select the department you would like to create a linked role for.
    3. Copy the role ID of the role you wish people to have in the **host** server and paste it in the box.
    4. Copy the role ID of the role you wish people to have in the **department** server and paste it in the box.

       <Note>
         To link department roles, you will need the role ID. It will greatly help you to first enable [developer mode](https://docs.duckybot.xyz/misc/devmode) on Discord.
