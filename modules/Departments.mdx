        <Warning>
          You cannot cross-unban somebody from all linked servers using Ducky; you must unban them from each server they were banned in manually.
        </Warning>
        To cross-ban somebody from the main server and all linked servers, you do it within the `/ban` command in itself. 

        There is an optional field labelled "**Departmental**". This boolean is automatically set to false, in order to cross-ban select "**True"** in the departmental field and execute the command.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Linked Roles" icon="link">
        <Note>
          To link roles, you will need to first enable [developer mode](https://docs.duckybot.xyz/misc/devmode) on Discord.
        </Note>
        In essence, if a member has a role in the Host server, Ducky will give the linked role in the Department Server and vice versa

        2. Select the department you would like to create a linked role for.
        3. Copy the role ID of the role you wish people to have in the **host** server and paste it in the box.
        4. Copy the role ID of the role you wish people to have in the **department** server and paste it in the box.
