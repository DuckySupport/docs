  <Step title="Introduction to Departments" titleSize="h2">
    With the departments module, you can:

    - Cross-ban members (Bans from the host server carry over to linked servers)
    - Sync Discord display names
    - Use linked roles
  </Step>
  <Step title="Linking Servers" titleSize="h2">
    <Note>
      To link department servers, you will need to first enable [developer mode](https://docs.duckybot.xyz/misc/devmode) on Discord
    </Note>
    1. First, you will need to decide which server will be your host, and run the command  `/setup` in your host server, then navigate down to the departments module
    1. Once on the department panel, navigate to the drop-down menu and select **Link Department**
    1. Obtain the server ID of the department you want to link and paste it into the box provided
    1. A message will be sent to the server owner of the department server, if they allow you to link the server, congratulations you are done!

      <Accordion title="Cross Bans" icon="ban">
        <Warning>
          You cannot cross-unban somebody from all linked servers using Ducky; you must unban from each server they were banned in
        </Warning>
        To cross-ban somebody from the main server and all linked servers you do it within the `/ban` command in itself. 

        There is an optional field labelled "**Departmental**". This boolean is automatically set to false, in order to cross-ban select "**True"** in the departmental field and execute the command.
