  <Step title="Understanding The Panels" titleSize="h2">
    To start with, the panels you will need to navigate through might be overwhelming at first, but we can get you through this!

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Multi-Embed Selector" icon="book">
        <Warning>
          This panel may not appear for you, as not all of our modules have this feature. Skip this drop-down if this doesn't appear.
        </Warning>
        On some of our embed editors, you will first be faced with the \*\*Multi-Embed Editor. \*\*You will first see a drop-down titled "Edit Embeds" and 3 buttons at the bottom titled "Variables" "Save" and "Delete". Let's dive in!

        ### Edit Embed's Dropdown:

        Upon pressing this drop-down menu, you will be given the following options:

        - Add Embed - Create a fresh new embed
        - Edit Embed - Edit a pre-existing embed 
        - Remove Embed - Delete a pre-existing embed 

        ### Interactive Buttons:

        At the bottom of this panel, you will find 5 buttons as listed below:

        - Variables - Provides a list of variables, explained under the**Advanced Customisation**  section of this page
        - Save - Once you are happy with your embed, you will be brought back to the panel and you will be able to save your changes 
        - Delete - If you are unhappy with your current embed, or if you need to restart from scratch, this permanently deletes your embed
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Embed-Editor" defaultOpen icon="paintbrush-pencil">
        <Note>
          For details on Variables and Import/Export, please go to **Advanced Customisation**.
        </Note>
        In the embed editor, you will be told what each feature of our embed editor does.

        - Edit Title - Change the title text of your embed
        - Edit Description - Change the main body of your text 
        - Edit Author - Add text at the top of the embed (With Icon)
        - Edit Footer - Add text at the bottom of the embed (With Icon)
        - Edit Thumbnail - Add a square image in the top right of the embed

        - Add Field - Add a field
        - Edit Field - Edit a field
        - Remove Field - Add a field

           _Fields are a way to keep the text in your main body organised into sections. A field inline dictates if the fields will be organised going down (Y) or sideways (N)_
        - Edit Colour - Change the sidebar's colour (Must use [hexadecimal](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) format)
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Customisation" titleSize="h2">
    If you want to enhance your embeds and make them interactive or exchange them between your servers, we will detail how it's done below.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Import/Export" icon="arrow-down-to-bracket">
        <Danger>
          Using import/export links with Ducky can result in your embed being used by other servers if stored publicly. If you do not want these links to be shared, store them privately; we are not accountable if your embed is used elsewhere.
        </Danger>
        ### Importing

        To import an embed from a different server, you will first need the export link (See heading below).

        Once you have this, you will need to Create/Edit an embed and scroll down to "Import" then insert your export link. 

        <Info>
          This will then add all embed content from the exported version. (Images, Text and Emojis). You will be able to edit the content as per your needs
        </Info>
        ### Exporting

        To export an embed, scroll down to the export option on the embed editor
