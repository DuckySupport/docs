This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky's **Roblox Verification** module, which allows you to manage and secure player verification within your ERLC private server. The module creates a centralized system for confirming player identities, ensuring that only verified users can access server features. To enable and configure this module, use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Roblox Verification** page.


### Verified Nickname
  **Verified Nicknames** are the nicknames that are assigned to a member once they complete the verification.

  #### Verified Nickname Variables

  The Verified Nicknames will change the users username after they've succesfully verified based on your variables.

  - `{roblox.username}`: The member's Roblox username.
  - `{roblox.display}`: The member's Roblox display name.
  - `{roblox.id}`: The member's Roblox ID.
  - `{discord.username}`: The member's Discord username.
  - `{discord.name}`: The member's Discord display name.
  - `{discord.id}`: The member's Discord ID.

### Verified Roles
The **Verified Roles** are the roles that are added to a user once they've completed verifcation.

### Unverified Roles
The **Unverified Role(s)** are the roles that are being removed once a user has completed the Verification.

### Use Bloxlink
The **Use Bloxlink** feature allows you to use Bloxlink for Verification and not Ducky's Verification. It utilises **Bloxlink's** public API to fetch roblox users without them having to be verified with Ducky..
