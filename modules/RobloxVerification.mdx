This page provides the essential configuration options for Ducky's **Roblox Verification** module, which allows you to manage and secure player verification within your ERLC private server. The module creates a centralized system for confirming player identities, ensuring that only verified users can access server features. To enable and configure this module, use the **`/setup`** command and navigate to the **Roblox Verification** page.

## Verified Username Variables:

The Verified Nicknames will change the users username after they've succesfully verified based on your variables.

- `{roblox.username}`: The member's Roblox username.
- `{roblox.display}`: The member's Roblox display name.
- `{roblox.id}`: The member's Roblox ID.
- `{discord.username}`: The member's Discord username.
- `{discord.name}`: The member's Discord display name.
- `{discord.id}`: The member's Discord ID.
