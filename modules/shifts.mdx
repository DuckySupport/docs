Features include shift statistics, administrative controls, and **GameLock**, which ensures staff are in-game before starting their shift. To enable and configure this module, use the `/setup` command and navigate to the **Shift Management** page.

    **What is GameLock?**

    The Gamelock feature requires a user to be in the ERLC server so that they can start their shift. If a user in not in the ERLC Server they won't be able to start their shift.\\

    If GameLock is disabled a user can start their shift without being in the ERLC Server.
