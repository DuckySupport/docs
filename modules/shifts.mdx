    - **What is GameLock?**\
      - The Gamelock feature requires a user to be in the ERLC server so that they can start their shift. If a user in not in the ERLC Server they won't be able to start their shift.\
      - If GameLock is disabled a user can start their shift without being in the ERLC Server.

  <Step title="Shift Types" titleSize="h2">
    - The **Shift Types **are the type of shift a user can use when running `/shift manage` . 
      - You can use the **Shift Types Builder** to create a name for the Shift, a role that gets automaticlly added to the user once they've started their shift, a On-Pause Role that gets automatically assigned to the user once they've Paused their shift. A quota can also be assigned per Shift Type.
