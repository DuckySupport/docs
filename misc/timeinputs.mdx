Whenever you're asked to input an **interval** or amount of **time**, you might realize that if you input **12 hours**, it'll become **12 seconds**. That's due to the way Ducky, and many other bots, read time inputs. Instead, you input the number, followed by the letter corresponding to the type of time.

- **Seconds:** `s`
- **Minutes:** `m`
- **Hours:** `h`
- **Days:** `d`
- **Weeks:** `w`
- **Years:** `y`

<Tip>
    **Examples:**
    - 15 seconds -> `15s`
    - 30 minutes -> `30m`
    - 12 hours -> `12h`
    - 6 hours, 30 minutes -> `6h30m`
    - 2 weeks -> `2w`
