Whenever you're asked to input an **interval** or amount of **time**, you might realize that if you input **12 hours**, it'll become **12 seconds**. This is because that's not how Ducky reads time. While we could implement that, that would make the internal code much more complicated as it would need to recognize the patterns of which people input time. Instead, you must input time with the amount followed by the type. The available types are:

* **Seconds:** `s`&#x20;
* **Minutes:** `m`&#x20;
* **Hours:** `h`&#x20;
* **Days:** `d`&#x20;
* **Weeks:** `w`&#x20;
* **Years:** `y`&#x20;

The types above are what you put after the amount of which you would like to add to the time. For example, if you would like to input a time of **5 days**, you would input `5d` . If you would like to input a time of **3 hours and 17 minutes**, you would input `3h17m`, and so on.
