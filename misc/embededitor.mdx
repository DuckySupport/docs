### Sharing Embeds

The **Import** and **Export** options on the **Embed Editor** allow you to share your embeds with other users across servers.

Pressing the **Export** button will generate a 31-character code of random combinations of letters and numbers. This code can be shared with other users, who can then use the **Import** option and paste in the code.

<Note>
  The **Embed Editor** only accepts exportables of the **Embed**, **Embeds**, or **Message** type. You can view an exportable's type via the **`/exportables view`** command.

### History Control

The **Undo** and **Redo** buttons on the **Embed Editor** allow you to easily undo/redo your changes in the event that you accidentally overwrite a large portion of your embed.
