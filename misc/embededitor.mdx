  <Step title="Sharing Embeds" titleSize="h3">
    The **Import** and **Export** options on the **Embed Editor** allow you to share your embeds with other users across servers.

    Pressing the **Export** button will generate a 31-character code of random combinations of letters and numbers. This code can be shared with other users, who can then use the **Import** option and paste in the code.

    <Note>
      The **Embed Editor** only accepts exportables of the **Embed** type. You can view an exportable's type via the **`/exportables view`** command.
