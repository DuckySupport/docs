The message editor is seen across Ducky, and is used to fully customize embeds that are found in Sessions, Welcome Messages, Tickets, and more. You can also create a message with the`/message` command.

### Creating Message

Most messages can be created within the configuration of your choice. This is mostly seen as a "Edit Embed" selection. Alternatively, use the command `/message` and get started.

### Editing Content

Content is the "base" message for the creator. This can simply be edited using plain text, just like how you type in Discord.

<Note>
  Some types of message editors may not have this option.

### Editing Embeds

Embeds are a great way to show messages within Discord, and you've probably seen them before. Embeds can be created, deleted, and edited within the Embed Editor.

### Multi Embed Editor

The multi-embed editor allows you to have multiple embeds within a message.

- Creating Embeds : Creates a new embed, which is placed at the bottom of the list.
- Editing Embeds : Edits a pre-existing embed.
- Deleting Embeds : Deletes a pre-existing embed.

<Danger>
  Deleting embeds is irreversible, and all data will be permanently lost.

### Editing Embeds

When you create an embed, or edit a pre-existing embed, another menu appears, allowing you to edit the selected embed.

**Title**\
The title is the main text shown on the top of the embed, although it can be below the author, if added.

**Description**\
The description is the secondary text, shown below the title. The description can contain up to 4000 characters.

**Author**\
The author is a small text shown above the titel, mainly used to show a server/user. The author can use text and/or an image.

**Footer**\
The fotter is small text shown at the bottom of the embed. This can also contain an image.

**Edit Thumbnail**\
The thumbnail is an image that can be displayed in the top-right of the embed.

**Edit Image**\
The image is an image that is displayed along the width of the embed, along the bottom, but above the footer.

**Fields**\
Fields are used to convey a topic within your embed. They contain a title and a description. Fields can also be chosen to be inline, which keeps multiple fields on the same line, instead of creating new lines.

**Color**\
The color is a HEX code, which is displayed along the left side of the embed. HEX codes can be found at https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker

### Variables

Variables are a way to refrence important information within a message or embed. To view avalible variables, check for a button labeled  <Icon icon="brackets-curly" /> Variables, and copy/paste one of the variables into your message, and when it's ran, that variable will be replaced with data, depending on the variable you chose!

### Importing / Exporting Messages

Importing and exporting messages can be very convenient for sharing embeds with others or copying embeds to others.

### Export Pre-Existing Embed

To export a pre-existing embed, open the message editor and click "Export Embed" and copy the code given. It should look similar to `ducky_xxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Import into a New Embed

Within a new message editor, click on "Import" and paste the ducky code from the export message.

<Note>
  To view your exportables, use the command **`/exportables owned`**
