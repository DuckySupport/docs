The message editor is seen across Ducky, and is used to fully customize embeds that are found in Sessions, Welcome Messages, Tickets, and more. You can also create a message with the`/message` command.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating Message" titleSize="h2">
    Most messages can be created within the configuration of your choice. This is mostly seen as a "Edit Embed" selection. Alternatively, use the command `/message` and get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Editing Content" titleSize="h2">
    Content is the "base" message for the creator. This can simply be edited using plain text, just like how you type in Discord.

    <Note>
      Some types of message editors may not have this option.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Editing Embeds" titleSize="h2">
    Embeds are a great way to show messages within Discord, and you've probably seen them before. Embeds can be created, deleted, and edited within the Embed Editor.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Multi Embed Editor" icon="code" titleSize="h3">
        The multi-embed editor allows you to have multiple embeds within a message.

        - Creating Embeds : Creates a new embed, which is placed at the bottom of the list.
        - Editing Embeds : Edits a pre-existing embed.
        - Deleting Embeds : Deletes a pre-existing embed.

          <Danger>
            Deleting Embeds is irreversible, and all data is lost.
          </Danger>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Editing Embeds" icon="message-arrow-up-right" titleSize="h3">
        When you create an embed, or edit a pre-existing embed, another menu appears, allowing you to edit the selected embed.

        <Steps>
          <Step title="Title">
            The title is the main text shown on the top of the embed, although it can be below the author, if added.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Description">
            The description is the secondary text, shown below the title. The description can contain up to 4000 characters.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Author">
            The author is a small text shown above the titel, mainly used to show a server/user. The author can use text and/or an image.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Footer">
            The fotter is small text shown at the bottom of the embed. This can also contain an image.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Edit Thumbnail">
            The thumbnail is an image that can be displayed in the top-right of the embed.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Edit Image">
            The image is an image that is displayed along the width of the embed, along the bottom, but above the footer.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Fields">
            Fields are used to convey a topic within your embed. They contain a title and a description. Fields can also be chosen to be inline, which keeps multiple fields on the same line, instead of creating new lines.
          </Step>
          <Step title="Color">
            The color is a HEX code, which is displayed along the left side of the embed. HEX codes can be found at https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Variables" icon="brackets-curly" titleSize="h3">
        Variables are a way to refrence important information within a message or embed. To view avalible variables, check for a button labeled  <Icon icon="brackets-curly" /> Variables, and copy/paste one of the variables into your message, and when it's ran, that variable will be replaced with data, depending on the variable you chose!
