The **`{timestamp}`** variable is one of the most confusing variables in Ducky for those who aren't familiar with Discord's formatting style. When using the variable without formatting, you'll receive a number such as **`1756645200`**. This isn't very useful, nor readable. To make it readable, you must add formatting as shown below.

- **Sunday, August 31, 2025 9:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:F>`
- **August 31, 2025 9:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:f>` or `<t:1756645200>`
- **August 31, 2025:** `<t:1756645200:D>`
- **8/31/2025:** `<t:1756645200:d>`
- **9:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:t>`
- **9:00:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:T>`
- **5 seconds ago:** `<t:1756645200:R>`

<Note>
  Be sure to replace the numbers with the **`{timestamp}`** variable. Example: **`<t:{timestamp}:R>`**.
</Note>

## Non-specific Timestamps

If you don't want to have a timestamp that states a specific time, and want to make it state the current time in any of the formats, pay attention.

- \*\*[Day of week,] [Month X,] [Year X:XX AM/PM:] \*\*`<t:timestamp:F>`
- **[Month X,] [Year X:XX AM/PM:]** `<t:timestamp:f` or `<t:timestamp>`
- **[Month X,] [Year:]** `<t:timestamp:D>`
- **X/XX/XXXX:** `<t:timestamp:d>`
- **[X:XX AM/PM:]** `<t:timestamp:t>`
- **[X:XX:XX:]** `<t:timestamp:T>`
- **[X] seconds ago:** `<t:timestamp:R>`

<Warning>
  All of the timestamps are **case sensitive**. If one letter is accidentally uppercase, it will not display properly or not work completely.
