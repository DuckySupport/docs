The **`{timestamp}`** variable is one of the most confusing variables in Ducky for those who aren't familiar with Discord's formatting style. When using the variable without formatting, you'll receive a number such as **`1756645200`**. This isn't very useful, nor readable. To make it readable, you must add formatting as shown below.

- **Sunday, August 31, 2025 9:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:F>`
- **August 31, 2025 at 9:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:f>`
- **August 31, 2025:** `<t:1756645200:D>`
- **8/31/2025:** `<t:1756645200:d>`
- **9:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:t>`
- **9:00:00 AM:** `<t:1756645200:T>`
- **5 seconds ago:** `<t:1756645200:R>`

<Warning>
    Be sure to replace the numbers with the **`{timestamp}`** variable. Example: **`<t:{timestamp}:R>`**.
