Automations are a sequence of actions that happen once your **trigger** is met. This can be selected in the editor. To start creating automations, use the command `/automations create`

<Danger>
  Ducky has a 10 automation limit for free users, with 5 actions per automation. Upgrading to Ducky Plus+ will give you up to 50 automations and 10 actions per automation.
